UML Diagram Explanation

* Display is the class that interacts with both CsvReader and JsonReader to fetch room data. 
    t takes a BaseReader instance (which could be an instance of CsvReader or JsonReader) and a file path as parameters. 
    The getRoomData method fetches and returns room data.

* BaseReader is an abstract class that defines the basic structure for classes that read data from different file formats.
    It has an abstract method readData that needs to be implemented by subclasses.

* CsvReader and JsonReader are subclasses of BaseReader. 
    They implement the readData method to read data from CSV and JSON files, respectively. 
    CsvReader also includes a cachedData property to store parsed CSV data.

* Room is the interface that describes the structure of room data.
